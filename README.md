# Password Generator
This is my first project that I publish on GitHub. A simple program that will generate a password of the required length and check it for reliability, and if the check fails, the password will be changed to improve security. The program can save your password in a .txt file. Perhaps soon there will be a function for saving to a .json file (if I want).
